# imgcook

[imgcook](https://www.imgcook.com/) is an ingenious chef who specializes in cooking with various images (Sketch / PSD / static images). it will intelligently generate front-end codes, including view codes, data-binding codes, component codes as well as part of business logic codes from different kinds of design documents.。<br />

We are making imgcook a P5 front-end engineer who could improve the development efficiency and promote the effective collaboration between front-end developers, designers and testers. We are looking forward to:

- 100% restore【Designer will not have to check how codes restore the design draft again】
- 100% compatible [Tester will not have to check the compatibility again]
- One-click Into Production [Front-end Developer will not have to do the slicing and bind the data. Taking the Tmall Double Eleven venue as an example, the current code availability is 79.43% (the code generated by imgcook and reserved after going online / the code on the total online code).

## Features

The main functions of imgcook are one-click restoration of design drafts and visual editing based on restoration.<br />
The restoration of Sketch / Photoshop design drafts starts with the installation of plugins. Export the JSON description of the design draft through the plug-in in the design draft and paste it into the imgcook visual editor.<br />
In the editor, you can edit the view, logic, etc. After generating the code, you can export the code to your local or your project file.<br />
In addition to the visual draft restoration service, we also provide engineering efficiency tools such as imgcook-cli, imgcook VS Code plug-ins, and also support developer custom DSL, custom Plugin, etc.<br />
In addition, we are also exploring the capabilities that AI has given to imgcook, such as image to code and text semantic understanding.<br />
For the created modules, you can also manage them by team and project dimensions. If you want to see some featured cases, you can go to the square to view them.<br />
